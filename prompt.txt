From the image, identify the main group identifier and the main activity title (e.g., 'IMPIAN') as 'activity_name'.
The K in the picture is an acronym that refers to 'Kumpulan' which in English means group.
Then, for each numbered item under the activity_name, extract its item number as 'item_no' and its text as 'description'.
Return a single JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "group_name": "string",
  "activity_name": "string",
  "items": [
    {"item_no": number, "description": "string"}
  ]
}
Extract text accurately. Do not summarize. Ensure all numbered items are captured.
